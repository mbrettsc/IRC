#  FT_IRC

This project is an implementation of an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server, following the specifications outlined in RFC 1459. IRC is a widely used protocol for real-time communication in the form of text messages between users in a network of servers. RFC 1459 defines the standards for IRC, covering various aspects such as message formats, server-client communication, channel management, and user authentication.

##  Commands

-  **BOT**: If the bot is connected to the server, it will broadcast a message to all clients, and the content of this message will be based on the first parameter provided

-  **CAP**: The CAP command serves as a handshake mechanism between server to HexChat and the bot

-  **HELPME**: The HELPME command provides users with explanations on how to connect to the server using Netcat. It is a helpful resource for users who may be new to the IRC environment or need assistance with the connection process.

-  **INFO**: The INFO command lists all available commands, serving as a quick reference guide for users to understand the functionalities offered by the IRC system.

-  **INVITE**: The INVITE command is used by operators to invite someone to a specific channel, granting them access to the channel's conversations and activities.

-  **JOIN**: The JOIN command allows users to either create a new channel or join an existing one, enabling them to participate in discussions within that channel.

-  **KICK**: The KICK command is a tool for channel operators to remove a user from a channel, maintaining control over the channel environment.

-  **LIST**: The LIST command provides a list of all channels along with their respective topics, offering users an overview of the available channels on the server.

-  **MODE**: Only operators use the MODE command, and it is related to channel settings. Operators can modify channel parameters, such as changing the channel's key or setting user limits.

-  **NICK**: The NICK command allows users to set or change their nickname, providing a personalized identifier for interactions on the IRC network.

-  **NOTICE**: The NOTICE command is used to send messages to clients, providing a means of communication between users without broadcasting the message to an entire channel.

-  **WHO**: The WHO command lists all users in a specific channel, offering a snapshot of the current participants in that channel.

-  **WHOIS**: The WHOIS command prints detailed information about a specific user, providing insights into their connection details and other relevant information.
